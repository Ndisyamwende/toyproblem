# Speed Detector

This program checks the speed of a car and determines whether it is within the speed limit or if the driver should receive demerit points.

## Challenge Description

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program should print: "License suspended".

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML structure for the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for speed detection.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the car speed in the input field.
